# opensearch-container

This is the Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile for building the image `elifesciences/opensearch`, 
[hosted at Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elifesciences/opensearch/).

It disables most of the extra plugins that come with OpenSearch 1.2.1 out of the box. They should be re-enabled as 
necessary.
